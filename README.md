A general purpose alarm clock computer, similar to a Chumby

Todo:
* Hook up buttons other than home button

Bugs:
* Too easy to drag instead of click buttons on screen
* White flash/long delay when switching apps

Ideas:
 * Prestart various applets and just show them when launched?  (Would increase startup speed at the expense of memory/CPU usage, so should probably make this optional within applets)
